# Functional JavaScript Experiment

A reimplementation of several building block in a functional way.

This is only for learning and testing, do not use it for any productive purpose.

## Requirements

No transpilation needed, but it'll use latest NodeJS version and some flags to simplify code wherever is possible.

 - Node v5+
 - flag "--harmony_rest_parameters"



## TODO

### implement

 * prop / pluck
 * while / until
 * always

### try
 * auto curry all
